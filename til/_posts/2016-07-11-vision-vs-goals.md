title: Product Vision vs Goals
layout: post
---
Over the past week or so, I have been trying to define just what a
"product vision" is. Communicating this has been difficult because I
don't have the professional experience to see what it looks like in
use by other companies.

## Goals of a Vision

* Provide a "gut-level" guide for making decisions.
* A unifying force for efforts across the company.

## What I Know so Far

* Vision is removed from implementation.
* The product leader is responsible for that vision, maintaining it, and communicating it.
* It should probably be language only, to keep implementation out of it.
* It doesn't end with creation, it must constantly be promoted.
* My main role needs to be as a facilitator between the two visionaries.
