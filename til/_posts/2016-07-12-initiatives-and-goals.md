title: Initiatives and Goals

Going off of yesterday's post, I've dug deeper into figuring out who to
manage the project. I now know that my role in this particular organization
has to be a facilitator between two visionaries.

As a facilitator, I need to keep a good record of decisions made and
extract goals from those decisions. It is an ad-hoc process, but I think
it will have the least friction as I find my footing in a process.

To aid in the process of finding a process, I've adopted a tool that has
a strong process built into it. [Aha.io](http://aha.io) has what seems
to be a strong opinion built into it with what parts of the process are
important and how they all interrelate. Two of the key features of this
process are goals and initiatives.

Goals are the high-level trackable efforts that the company/product it
tackling. For example, to boost sales by X amount. Initiatives are also
high-level company/product efforts, but they are more specific. At this
point in my understanding, the best way for me to explain it is with an
example. An initiative can be to make a website mobile friendly. That
initiative may be one way of actualizing a goal. A goal can have many
initiatives, and an initiative may impact many goals, but the key
difference is that it is a step of actualization.
