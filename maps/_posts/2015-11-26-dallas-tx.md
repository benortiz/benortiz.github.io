This chunk of Dallas suburbia has evidence of nearly all the major patterns of
suburban development. In the north-east, curvy roads to slow traffic. Just south,
dense traditional blocks. To the east of that, a neighborhood that closes itself
off from the rest by limiting the roads in. In the mid-west, a business park.
And in the east, suburban blocks with large yards all around.
